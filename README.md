## About
Implementation of Haskell's prelude in JavasScript, as close as possible.

## Why

If you've been living in the functional world and suddenly were introuduced to the JavaScript world, you know how painful it feels. I miss Haskell's types, classes, abstructions and functions. 


## How

I like to keep things simple so I will keep all I need in just one file.
